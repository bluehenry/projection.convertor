Convert Geographic Coordinates (longitude/latitude) to Map Projection
Geographic coordinate systems (GCS) most commonly have units in decimal degrees measuring degrees of longitude (x-coordinates) and degrees of latitude (y-coordinates).
The location of data is expressed as positive or negative numbers: positive x- and y-values for north of the equator and east of the prime meridian, and negative values for south of the equator and west of the prime meridian.

Spatial data can also be expressed using projected coordinate systems (PCS).
Coordinates are expressed using linear measurements rather than angular degrees.
Finally, some data may be expressed in a local coordinate system with a false origin (0, 0 or other values) in an arbitrary location that can be anywhere on earth.

A projection is the means by which you display the coordinate system and your data on a flat surface, such as a piece of paper or a digital screen.
